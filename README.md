This is the android application that I have developend during my internship.

The application is build using ML kit of Firebase. I have integrated 4 Machine learning models in this application that are:
1) Language Translator
2) Barcode Scanner
3) Smart Reply
4) Image Labeling

All these 4 models are integrated into a single application.
